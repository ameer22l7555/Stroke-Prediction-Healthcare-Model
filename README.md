# 🏥 Stroke Prediction Healthcare Model 🧠

## 📊 Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of stroke occurrence based on various health and demographic factors. Using a comprehensive healthcare dataset, the model analyzes patterns and risk factors associated with strokes to provide predictive insights.

## 🔍 Dataset Description
The dataset contains healthcare information with the following features:
- 👤 **Gender**: Male, Female, or Other
- 🎂 **Age**: Age of the patient
- 🩸 **Hypertension**: 0 if the patient doesn't have hypertension, 1 if the patient has hypertension
- ❤️ **Heart Disease**: 0 if the patient doesn't have any heart diseases, 1 if the patient has a heart disease
- 💍 **Ever Married**: "Yes" or "No"
- 💼 **Work Type**: Type of employment (Private, Self-employed, Govt_job, children, Never_worked)
- 🏙️ **Residence Type**: "Rural" or "Urban"
- 🧪 **Average Glucose Level**: Average glucose level in blood
- ⚖️ **BMI**: Body Mass Index
- 🚬 **Smoking Status**: "formerly smoked", "never smoked", "smokes", or "Unknown"
- 🎯 **Stroke**: 1 if the patient had a stroke, 0 if not (target variable)

## 🧮 Model Development
The project implements a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier to predict stroke occurrence. The development process includes:

1. 🧹 **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Feature scaling

2. 🔄 **Model Training**:
   - Splitting data into training and testing sets
   - Training the KNN model with optimized parameters

3. 📏 **Model Evaluation**:
   - Assessing model performance using accuracy metrics
   - Analyzing prediction results

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Clone this repository
